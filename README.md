# Udacity-Machine-Learning

Code completed for the Udacity Machine learning coursework. This course runs through different algorithms and how to implement them in Python. 

The course has several modules in it. Each notebook relates to a module from the course:
  1. Naive Bayes
  2. SVM
  3. Decision Trees
  4. Choose Your Own Algorithm 
      - the class puts forward three different algorithms and you test how each improves accuracy
  5. Datasets and Questions 
      - Researching the Enron dataset and performing small analysis on it and how it could affect your ML algorithms.
